## The Journey
1. Revisit the Cloud Basics :speech_balloon:
2. Come up with the learning plan :dash:
3. Make a point to stick to the plan and make wellness a point too :curry:
4. Upload the content here on daily basis :notes:
5. Be presentation ready on your content :thumbsup:
6. Live in the glory of the learned brain :sparkles:
7. Now that you have learned cloud, take a break, go for an outing...:checkered_flag: :moyai:  

** To Pursue Cloud Computing Mastery path, one should have 4-7 years of hands-on experience on the DevOps, Microservices, Security, and Full Stack Architecture Design Patterns. I would recommend you to revisit few IT related courses preferably around IT networking and Linux fundamentals for in-depth knowledge in these areas before venturing on the Cloud. To be frank, it depends on the experience level and your interest in the Cloud to come up with flying colors in this area. For the starters, take a cloud practitioner/essentials course exam and gets hands-on on cloud, it would take 6 months and anybody can take it whether you are 18 yrs. old or 40 yrs. old, it doesn't matter, just hop on to your cloud express :bullettrain_front:. Just make sure that you don't mug up things for a while but it should be pragmatic exprerience as well. And, if you're planning for masters, select your masters' programme as per your interest and continue on technical area side by side:vertical_traffic_light:. For more, you can keep my YouTube Playlist below as a reference, I keep on updating these as per industry requirements

## Crossing the bridge

- [ ] 12 SEP 2022 > Attended Exam prep by AWS and took Mock tests, subscribed more webinars on my Calendar around cloud  
- [ ] 13 SEP 2022 > So, in the next few days, I'm going to put myself in motion so that I enjoy cloud ride along with my work. For this, I'm going through few Bootcamps on Udemy, Practice tests, and Exam Prep readiness material everyday since naming conventions are different in every cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) but I'm taking AWS first. And, I have to read blogs, docs, news, and new features around it as well.
- [ ] 14 SEP 2022 > Going through few topics on Cloud again, from the next month onwards, my classes would start and I am going to post my activity seldom here   
- [ ] 15 SEP 2022 > Took it slow today  
- [ ] 16 SEP 2022 > Found a good DevOps Library, auditing today https://lms.simplilearn.com/courses/4305/Introduction-to-Devops-Tools

- [ ] 23 SEP 2022 > Attended AWS Cloud Practitioner Event https://classnotes.puser.info/CPELinks_v3.html and checked in file in the Content folder  
- [ ] 26 SEP 2022 > Calendar full of AWS Events is all I wanted to put myself on Cloud 9  
- [ ] 29 SEP 2022 > Finished a few courses on https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/ and enrolled myself on Associate track  
- [ ] 30 SEP 2022 > After first 40 days of arranging courses, webinars, websites, materials, and events on the cloud, I am feeling confident that I can start with my deeper level of understanding now   
- [ ] 02 OCT 2022 > Found a link to GCP Interactive Cheat sheet https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/  
- [ ] 07 OCT 2022 > Attended three days workshop on AWS QuickSight https://bit.ly/3SMGeqV

- [ ] 11 OCT 2022 > AWS Power-hour links https://bit.ly/3fUCHIy , https://go.aws/3TbF5Ju, && https://bit.ly/3fUCHIy  
- [ ] 18 OCT 2022 > Busy with the Partner events from past few weeks, gonna update my progress on the Cloud Exam soon ...  
- [ ] 20 OCT 2022 > After being enticed by Cloud right from the beginning, I was so hesitant when I started with the AWS in the month of August, but it felt like Computer Science with different nomenclature, so, I continued. Although, I have experience in every area of IT and Development but still, Cloud is a Cloud. Phew! I feel alright now ... FOMO can become real sometimes... Next, Azure & GCP, will update in the next year. Today, I got a link to AWS Resources https://resources.awscloud.com/   
- [ ] 29 OCT 2022 > Still attending training from AWS on components...Well, it may differ from person to person but as an architect brain, I like to study everything in one go. However, I was busy in too many training, hence, I could not study for certfication in the last month, I'll take it the coming months. As of now, I'm entering into the lab assignments phase which would take another month to hands-on on components    
- [ ] 9 NOV 2022 > Still in training mode, but I learned about partner competency program https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/competencies/  

## Into the bushy, thorny forest

- [ ] 16 NOV 2022 > Last month, I revisited Cybersecurity theoretical concepts from OWASP, CompTIA, CISSP, ITIL, and InfoSec to understand security layer and compliances associated with the Cloud. Not a very good strategy, but I had to brush up on everything quickly to start with the lab session in the AWS training. One can definitely skip this step for the last, but I would recommend to revisit basics of Cybersecurity and pen testing for work  
- [ ] 21 NOV 2022 > Submitted my first assignment in Cloud Computing program... Since August 20th, I am going through all cloud offerings online, and I chose to start with the AWS first. Seriously, even after having experience in the industry, at 12 years of experience, I conclude, AWS or Azure or GCP, you cannot do it in weeks, you need to start at one service and keep connecting services on cloud. Though, my area is difficult because it starts with EC2 and S3, go to containerization to EKS along with security factor. However, I am mainly working Data strategy and management which opens up plethora of services and code pipeline on AWS. I'm advised to take it slow, otherwise, I will be exhausted with office work. I kind of drew a similar conclusion in case of hands-on work on the cloud. You cannot do it in a day, so, I'm taking small steps after completing basics, EC2, Storage Options, and WAF. Harder part starts now    
- [ ] 22 NOV 2022 > AWS Cloud is not just a Cloud deployment or for migration. Post migration, we can actually do a lot in the data analytics and machine learning area as well. Since I have a decent experience in development area, I want to take it further to the next level. In few months, I will be done with the basics. So, I'm picking AWS SageMaker and Tensorflow to evaluate few services offered by AWS as I liked their training on Data Analytics.  
- [ ] 27 NOV 2022 > Still going through the AWS services, however, starting with Containers on AWS for this month as my assignment is due at the end of December. Holiday season is ON for me, I have no idea how would I study in the cold winter season again, but let's see, maybe coffee, green tea, and hot chocolate will help along with Xmas playlist on YouTube. Wrong choices, but I don't want to miss the Xmas vibe of this year because of my academic routine.  
- [ ] 28 NOV 2022 > I furthered my security concepts from CISA, CISM, CRISC, NIST, OWASP, and CISSP again, but I completely detested myself for not watching FIFA matches. Information workload is real, I think, at this point when innovation management is becoming real, anybody who is in their early 30s and getting the assignment of technology management in any area might be feeling confused as it is too much work to understand in one go. Basics covered, time to move on to the next level.  


## Trekking the dunes

- [ ] 6 DEC 2022 > Completed my CBAP training with assessment yesterday. Woohoo! This one is done now. I needed to revise the basics to understand the Enterprise Architecture in the business transformation, though you'll be hearing a different view on CBAP as TOGAF is the one but to study TOGAF, COBIT, ITIL, and other Enterprise Architecture Governance guideleines, CBAP will provide the good foundation. Even if you are experienced, I would recommed 5 years of continuous learning here to begin with Enterprise Architectures. Although, if you do CBAP and PMP, you are good to go at your job in the workplace. We don't need to dig in deep as they might not be your areas, but just general awareness if you do not practice them. However, for me, I required them as I continued studying Enterprise Architectures since bachelors and worked on few as Developer/Lead. Though I studied E-Business before along with consulting tools and technqiues but taking exams is not like everyday activity, I'd to dedicate a lot of time and effort to pass  the assessment without revising the BaboK post training lessons. Finally, from this month onwards, I will be working on Containers on AWS and will be training MooC soon on it as well. Though the test will be on the easier side, but I am hoping to start on Containers ASAP as this is directly related to my work in code refactoring.  
- [ ] 9 DEC 2022 > Well, micro and macro setting always makes me go all over the places to see how the solutions are actually implemented using newer Saas products in the market. I wouldn't say I don't work on IaaS and PaaS but I come from product development, I mainly work on configuration on container using Git, DevOps tools, Java, and Databases. Though, I'm really looking forward to automation but that's not possible either. So, you see, a lot of integration happens in the product development which consumes like of energy initially. It's like economies of scale definitely. Coming back to the Container on AWS topic, I will be starting with pipeline today, let's see how it goes.   
- [ ] 10 DEC 2022 > Started with Containers from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-virtualization-containers-api-duke?specialization=building-cloud-computing-solutions-at-scale" target="blank">Cloud Virtualization, Containers and APIs</a> along with my Post Graduate Program at Great Lakes which is also running Containers on Cloud all month.  
- [ ] 12 DEC 2022 > Revising few DevOps areas again to follw up with the micro areas for Containers changes. Next App Modernization https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud/   
- [ ] 21 DEC 2022 > Delayed few things as I have to wrap this year as quickly as I can as I was committed to a massive learning goal this year, some areas were refresher while others really took toll on my sleeping patterns all year, but what to do though government/institution(s) tries to teach you mostly in bachelors and masters, but disruption gets real. So, sometimes, you have to become extra vigilant to these changing patterns & paradigm shifts and make a point to follow-through through updates in your niche, hence, I did...    
- [ ] 24 DEC 2022 > Watched two movies on the Christmas eve, The Addams Family & Ram Setu   
- [ ] 25 DEC 2022 > Started on my assignment, two case studies, Containers on AWS and Lululemon Atheletica, have to submit in two days.  
- [ ] 02 JAN 2023 > In the past 8 days, I submitted my assignment on Containers on AWS, then post-submission, I had good four days rest without any heavy reading material. So, I focused on planning ahead for the year 2023, spent few hours watching Christmas flicks as I was busy on Christmas with my pending tasks, then I wanted to finish them before we enter into 2023. HAPPY NEW YEAR :tada:!  
- [ ] 10 JAN 2023 > Started with AWS Services now... Couple of months ago, I didn't want to look at the cloud interface with work, now, it feels why did that even  happen? I hope it's fluidic now, now, I will not hate the ugliness in switching platforms while working. Sometimes, meditation helps in compartmentalizing the tasks in your brain or we can say repetition helps in hardwiring. I'll update on the Services links post this month.  
- [ ] 18 JAN 2023 > Attended Migration Business Case Development again to assess report on https://accelerate.amazonaws.com/  
- [ ] 21 JAN 2023 > It has been such a long time that I'm studying cloud, but still, I'm looking further to see, what did I miss here. Perhaps, it could be hands-on on the newer things as I'm busy with microservices & business analysis, but again, brain is brain, it wants more out of this experience. Today, I spotted AWS Lambda lab work https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/translating-documents-at-enterprise-scale-with-serverless/   
- [ ] 29 JAN 2023 > AWS is finished and I will be starting with the Associate track prep soon. Registered myself to the AWS APN ride today https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/lp/1651/solution-architect-associate-accelerator-partner-learning-plan/  
- [ ] 31 JAN 2023 > Along with AWS Associate track, for work, I'm starting with the GCP Partner track #40daystoGCPEngineer https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/8. But, as per my Cloud training program, I wll be busy in Azure cloud introduction for two months as well. I'll be definitely winding through the Canyons now, so many courses in parallel. Also, I don't recommend self study in so many areas, tried it a decade ago in different area of industry. You do need a trainer/mentor to direct you throughout your cloud journey. I would recommend you to take training programs available on the Internet. Mine is scheduled for 2 hours session on Saturday mornings and they also plan breaks, activities & assignments as well. Further, whatever I'm studying, it's because of my work, not the training program. Although, they both are rigorous right now that I'm only planning sound sleep & a little bit of creativity on my journal. Otherwise, I'll burnout, which I don't recommend, that means, you are not ready, take a break & come back later. Honestly speaking, it's a big world, you can't mug up everything in a day. If you get that scope creep feeling, step back for a few days, then come back, try again & succeed. Just don't give up, the world will be yours...     
- [ ] 4 FEB 2023 > I'm working on my last assignment and practice assessments this weekend, but every time, I look at question set, it seems a new bouncer on my head. It is a virtual world that I'm looking at and I have to take vendor certifications as well. Let's see, I'm trying to take it slow, but industry is moving at a fast pace and I definitely feel a cloud services deficit in real because of cloud native app development. My work is similar, I'm motivated to migrate on to the cloud, but still, this is not an easy topic. Hopefully, my deadline to scale up on the cloud will turn out alright & I would less FOMO.   
- [ ] 7 FEB 2023 > Submitted my final AWS assignment in my coursework, let's see. Now, it's time for Azure track. Meanwhile, I also have to prepare for GCP engineer. Hopefuly, I'll be able to crack it by the end of March.  

## Winding through the canyons
- [ ] 14 FEB 2023 > Starting with the major Cloud providers sessions daily now for the next 3 months. That was the aim right from the very beginning. Coming from the development & support background, it is very difficult to boot up on cloud in a day. Hence, training was necessary. My profile is more like business analyst + data scientist + business operations developer + build/deploy + testing/release >> product management. Now, you know why cloud, because I loved it. First time, I did not hesitate to pay for the programme and I enrolled myself, but there were hurdles too. Anyway, now, it's more like melting pot of all major providers' updates here, but this month, I will be focussing mainly on Azure.  
- [ ] 25 FEB 2023 > Azure started in my program https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/  
                                                https://news.microsoft.com/stories/microsoft-datacenter-tour/ 
                                                https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/implement-network-security/  
- [ ] 28 FEB 2023 > Stumbled on Cloud Comparison https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison  
- [ ] 1 MAR 2023 > Found an amazing link on GCP https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/  
- [ ] 4 MAR 2023 > Today, I'm attending session on Azure storage https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction. Got to know, S3 bucket and azure storage is also possible solution.  
- [ ] 4 MAR 2023 > Create serverless applications https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-serverless-applications/  
- [ ] 15 MAR 2023 > After six months of continuous researching around cloud, finally, I'm able to read and watch around cloud seamlessly for hours. I would not lie, before this research around big 3 platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), I was a little lost in the cloud offerings. But because I'm from the same industry, cloud and server terms were not new to me, I could scale up quickly. Otherwise, at this age, I would have dragged the topic far far far away from me... To be honest, I think around people belonging to same age as me, anyway, my cohort is different, so, I'd to scale up, again, let's not lie, I'm enjoying cloud now. Hopefully, I'll update on use cases soon here. GCP Engineer training is over today as well, I can browse through cloud services on all cloud platforms now.  
- [ ] 16 MAR 2023 > Again, multiple things on the track, I have to submit Azure courserwork as well in Great Lakes this month and take GCP Certification, but health first, I'm sleeping well and eating healthy, no deep fried stuff... It's go or no-go situation for certification as per my daily schedule. If I don't have a bandwidth, then it'll be delayed because prep material is still in pending state and I'm not getting time to finish, even after prioritizing. Well, we can't keep isolating ourselves for every exam as there are lot of things that run in parallel both in personal and professional spaces, but niche is niche, we cannot sway from our goals, that must be achieved even after delays and backlogs. What is done must be done...  

## Stumbling through the caves  
- [ ] 22 MAR 2023 > Changed my target from 40 days to take GCP Engineer exam to 60 days as I'm new to platform and I don't want to rush and do it all over again by cramming the concepts. I'm taking my time to go through labs and concepts well because it is a must knowledge for anybody going through the cloud concepts, anyway, it is a base of the cloud platforms. Second, I postponed taking PMP exam from 100 days to 120 days again as as a manager, I want to stay healthy too. To be frank, I submitted around 8 assignments in the last 5 months with tests and cleared one PG Program last to last week. I think, I must indulge in the glory of completing the courseworks and certification too. Why to lose life, the cloud journey will continue for the rest of anybody's life, it's a base! However, I don't want to be lenient right now, so, after attending the convocation on the 23rd March i.e., tomorrow, I'm putting the Beast Mode on to complete my certs sooner.   
- [ ] 23 MAR 2023 > Preparing for the release, meanwhile, started attending training on DevOps. If you're fresher/newbie, don't try this method because it's brute force for you. You'll end up having **crammed head**, and 6 months later, you won't be able to recall anything, because you did not submerge yourself into the area. However, I worked on this area, for me, it's not new, but an update, yet, I want to relax, eat food, and watch news/movies. Getting back to the topic, I am on multiple EdTech platforms for the Cloud Transformation and yes, I'm finally watching everything I studied in my Bachelor's 14 years ago.   
- [ ] 12 APR 2023 > In the last two months, my tracking went awry because of multiple Intermediate level Assignments, plus too many tools hands on along with 45 hours workweek. I'm anticipating, till June end, I'd be able to streamline everything around cloud and devops, many things should be sorted, but yes, even after fast track programs/diplomas, you need to follow up for at least 12-18 months to understand the other subliminal aspect of the system, choose your track wisely (this is what I told myself since I enetered into industry, 2009). Also, we cannot do everything at once, however, slowly, we pick up the pace, one by one. Hopefully, I should meet my personal deadlines by June and check few milestones as well. Nevertheless, as I'm a part of the two PG programs, one is already completed and the other will be completed in June, things will be clearer and new milestones will be created thereafter. Good thing is my GCP labwork is also completed and I'm able to recall everything despite going through them quickly.     
- [ ] 15 APR 2023 > I completed my self study around the GCP-ACE certification once and now, I have to practice mock tests and exam questions myself for a month. Find my notes here https://github.com/shobhikabharti/CloudTransformation/tree/main/GCP   
- [ ] 22 APR 2023 > Little off track, but you might be interested in front end libraries like me for SaaS work, however, if you're in IaaS and PaaS, you might not need to go through JS libraries for UIUX work  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries, https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/   
- [ ] 24 APR 2023 > Found a reference library by the Cloud Girl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQvLUMjzg4&list=PLTWE_lmu2InBzuPmOcgAYP7U80a87cpJd&index=1  
- [ ] 1 MAY 2023 > Every day, classes/training on cloud is adding new data to my head and despite backlog, I have to move ahead with the work. All I can say is I'm not getting enough time to complete any concepts and everyone says, you'll never have much time, but you have to move ahead. I don't want to hear any voices now and I want to sit with teh backlog & check them one by one, but topics are all piled up for some reason. In office, there is new data entering every day whether it is in form of person I'm talking to, whether it is a new process/theory, or whether it is a new tool. Last week, I missed two of my classes and this is what I felt today. Last to last, I was sick too. At this point, a mediocre learner in your circle would say, "leave, it's okay", but here's to last six months deep work on the cloud, perhaps, you can say a deep research + hands-on on the cloud platforms. What would you say to yourself at this point? Would you leave or would you march ahead to completion?    

Ge your hands dirty https://console.cloud.google.com/  

## Resting at the Lagoon
- [ ] 15 JULY 2023 > So, finally, after so much hustle and bustle, I cleared my second PG program in Cloud Computing last week. Yay! It took me so much effort to clear coursework, you have to pat my back though I'm a little bit older now :D. But anyway, a very big milestone is achieved at this point. Now, eyes on certifications, I have to update Google ACE & PCA journey too.
- [ ] 21 FEB 2024 > Finally, after a long pause on Git, today, I wanted to update on my certification journey. My exam GCP CDL is scheduled on Sunday and I am 80% ready to go for it. Will update again...
- [ ] 25 FEB 2024 > **GCP Cloud Digital Leader: Passed!!!** Hurray, bought some ice cream to celebrate, will make a sundae at home! 

## Up into the mountains
- [ ] 16 JAN 2025 > Since the last year, I did not get the time to pursue PCA, but today, I am starting again. Let's see our journey together. For this one, I got to know that we have to prepare for case studies for the test. I am okay, but not okay. I can feel the pressure, but then what's the point of getting started and not achieving what you were set to do in the first place. This is totally my thing and I can do it. See ya for tomorrow.
- [ ] 24 MAR 2025 > So, I had to cancel my exam because I thought my macbook might not be able to survive the test, why? it's a decade old macbook air. Then, in all budgeting, planning, and preparing, I received a sad news, so, I completed all my blocked items due to some project priorities. Meanwhile, I finshed my training on Apigee, more relevant for my API development. Now, I have time again, so, I will complete a couple of things around ML and Database in the next month. Sometimes, I am like, why do I have to go and become a geek in the area if time doesn't allow, but then, I enjoy what I do and I am an Architect Engineer from the last several years, now, it's more management around the same. It's just some people block you while you are working on your items in isolation. It's more frustrating, when equals start behaving like managers and disturb you all day with false items or unnecessary meetings. All I can say, this year started on a bad note as cloud devops training happened in the past 3 years, ones who could pass these tests, they are working. Ones who are not up to mark, then constantly add tension to the system. As a Manager, I would feel bad around changes and laying off people if they do not belong to the technology now. Then, the question is to everybody and everyone is "Why Now?". This could have been told to everyone right at the beginning. But then, this is exactly, what I also pointed out 14 years ago that technology graduates are keen to jump on the bandwagon and they will sail.
- [ ] 25 APR 2025 > Started with Machine Learning instructer led training by GCP again, I'm more than half way through, but not able to follow along. Good thing is they have supporting deck with these trainings and I can refer later or on weekends, but think about me, from 20 years, I am going through products after products and no rest at all. Gosh, I want a good vacation somewhere here.
- [ ] 28 APR 2025 > My fatigue symptoms show up when I do not even know where these components connect sometimes when so many products show up on the market. You get this feeling when you are feeling tired looking at these courses, it is not even my own researched links, I am going through modules shared by GCP or AWS. Huh! The good thing is there is a community and there is someone at the office to take care of a few things if I am not around, otherwise, sometimes, it happens that only some of us are designated to look after the task even when we say it is 9 AM to 5 PM job. I work as a marketer staging products defect free for product go live and everytime it was successful, but now there are so many components that I had to take regular multiple training alongside work. Though, I feel awesome, only filtered content is going to my head these days and I do feel pumped up by recent product launches all around the world, but training fatugue is real for me now. I need a vacation I guess.

## Into the sky to touch the cloud!
